  abstract = {This study analyzes the first direct, mass-resolved observations of heliospheric pickup ions beyond the orbit of Jupiter. The Cassini Plasma Spectrometer observes H+, He+, He++, and O+ pickup ions of interstellar origin between 6.4 and 8.2 AU. Cassini's trajectory carries it through the downstream direction where we observe enhancements in the pickup He consistent with gravitational focusing by the Sun. We also show the first in situ observations of an “interstellar hydrogen shadow” where pickup H is depleted in the region behind the Sun relative to the local interstellar flow. Most H atoms cannot penetrate into this downstream shadow region both because the outward force due to radiation pressure exceeds gravitational attraction at this time and because H atoms trying to enter the shadow must pass close by the Sun where they have a high probability of being ionized and swept out with the solar wind.},

  abstract = {Measurements of the composition and spatial distribution of pick-up ions inside the heliosphere are reviewed. The first interstellar 4He+pick-up ions were detected with the SULEICA instrument on the AMPTE spacecraft near Earth's orbit. Most data on pick-up ions were taken in the solar-wind and suprathermal energy range of SWICS on Ulysses while the spacecraft cruised from 1.4 to 5.4 AU and explored the high-latitude heliosphere and solar wind from the ecliptic to {\textpm} 80{\textdegree} heliolatitude. This includes the discovery of H+, 4He++, 3He+, N+,O+, and Ne+ pick-up ions that originate from the interstellar neutralgas penetrating the heliosphere. From their fluxes properties of the interaction region between the heliosphere and the Local Interstellar Cloud such as the limits on filtration and the strength of the interstellar magnetic field have been revealed. Detailed analysis of the velocity distributions of pick-up ions led to 1) the discovery of a new distinct source, the so-called Inner Source, consisting of atoms released from interstellar and interplanetary dust inside the heliosphere, 2) the determination of pick-up ion transport parameters such as the long mean free path for pitch-angle scattering of order1 AU, and 3) detailed knowledge on the very preferential injection and acceleration of pick-up ions during interplanetary energetic particle events such as Co-rotating Interaction Regions and Coronal Mass Ejections. SWICS measurements have fully confirmed the theory of Fisk, Koslovsky, and Ramaty that pick-up ions derived from the interstellar gas are the dominant source of the Anomalous Cosmic Rays; they are pre-accelerated inside the heliosphere and re-accelerated at the solar-wind Termination Shock according to Pesses, Eichler, and Jokipii. The data indicate that the Inner Source of pick-up ionsis largely responsible for the occurence of C+ in the Anomalous Cosmic Rays. The abundances of recently discovered Inner-Source Mg+ and Si+ are solar-wind like and consistent with their abundances in the energetic particles associated with Co-rotating Interaction Regions. Knowledge on the injection and acceleration processes in Co-rotating Interaction Regions is applied to discuss the current observational evidence for the Interplanetary Focusing Cone of the interstellar neutral gas due to the Sun's gravitational force. The 25--150 keV/amu suprathermal 4He+ pick-up ion fluxes measured by CELIAS/STOF on board SOHO over 360{\textdegree} of ecliptic longitude represent a `local' ionization and acceleration of interstellar atoms at 1 AU or smaller heliocentric distances. Completing the first limited data set of SULEICA/AMPTE on 4He+ pick-up ions they indicate a density enhancement in the Interplanetary Focusing Cone which is confirmed by recent SWICS/ACE data. Clear evidence for signatures in ecliptic longitude are found in the data on energetic neutral H fluxes observed with the CELIAS/HSTOF sensor on board SOHO. These fluxes are enhanced in the upstream and downstream directions of the interstellar wind. Detection of energetic H atoms, which propagate unaffected by the Heliospheric Magnetic Field, provided for the first time a diagnostic tool for observations near Earth to analyze the structure in ecliptic longitude of the interface region between the heliosphere and the Local Interstellar Cloud.},

  abstract = {The flux density of ions created by ionization of interstellar neutral particles in the solar system and picked up by the solar wind is calculated as a function of the neutral particles. A very broad maximum occurs at an angle of 0 and a distance that depends on the density and speed of the neutral particles and on the ionization time but is typically in the general region of 10 AU. For atomic hydrogen the flux density is estimated to exceed 104 cm?2 s?1 over the distance range from a few to nearly 100 AU. The velocity space distribution of the interstellar ions is calculated under the assumption of no significant energy diffusion but with inclusion of adiabatic effects as well as a possible strong pitch angle diffusion. The energy spectrum is highly nonthermal and much broader than that of the solar wind ions; under the assumed conditions, interstellar protons are easily distinguishable from solar wind protons by their location in velocity space. If charge exchange is an important contributor to the ionization of hydrogen, the observed local intensity of interstellar protons should exhibit time variations correlated with the density changes of the solar wind stream structure.},

  abstract = {The ESA/NASA spacecraft Ulysses is making, for the first time, direct measurements in the solar wind originating from virtually all places where the corona expands. Since the initial two polar passes of Ulysses occur during relatively quiet solar conditions, we discuss here the three main regimes of quasi-stationary solar wind flow: the high speed streams (HSSTs) coming out of the polar coronal holes, the slow solar wind surrounding the HSSTs, and the streamers which occur at B-field reversals. Comparisons between H-$\alpha$ maps and data taken by Ulysses demonstrate that as a result of super-radial expansion, the HSSTs occupy a much larger solid angle than that derived from radial projections of coronal holes. Data obtained with SWICS-Ulysses confirm that the strength of the FIP effect is much reduced in the HSSTs. The systematics in the variations of elemental abundances becomes particularly clear, if these are plotted against the time of ionisation (at the solar surface) rather than against the first ionisation potential (FIP). We have used a superposed-epoch method to investigate the changes in solar wind speed and composition measured during the 9-month period in 1992/93 when Ulysses regularly passed into and out of the southern HSST. We find that the patterns in the variations of the Mg/O and O7+/O6+ ratios are virtually identical and that their transition from high to low values is very steep. Since the Mg/O ratio is controlled by the FIP effect and the O7+/O6+ ratio reflects the coronal temperature, this finding points to a connection between chromospheric and coronal conditions.},

  abstract = {The origins of the hot solar corona and the supersonically expanding solar wind are still the subject of much debate. This paper summarizes some of the essential ingredients of realistic and self-consistent models of solar wind acceleration. It also outlines the major issues in the recent debate over what physical processes dominate the mass, momentum, and energy balance in the accelerating wind. A key obstacle in the way of producing realistic simulations of the Sun-heliosphere system is the lack of a physically motivated way of specifying the coronal heating rate. Recent models that assume the energy comes from Alfv{\'e}n waves that are partially reflected, and then dissipated by magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, have been found to reproduce many of the observed features of the solar wind. This paper discusses results from these models, including detailed comparisons with measured plasma properties as a function of solar wind speed. Some suggestions are also given for future work that could answer the many remaining questions about coronal heating and solar wind acceleration.},

  abstract = {It has been hypothesized for quite some time that interplanetary pick-up
ions due to energization taking place in the region close to the solar
wind termination shock, at some fraction and as an outcome of a
complicated chain of processes, eventually are converted into species of
the anomalous cosmic-ray particles. For the actual conversion efficiency
it is of great importance to know the energy distribution of these
pick-up ions upon their arrival at the shock. It turns out that
pre-acceleration of these ions during their passage through the
heliosphere shall substantially increase their chances to become
reflected at the shock into the upstream direction which is a
prerequisite for a further climb-up in energy by virtue of Fermi-1
acceleration processes. In this paper we start out from stochastically
pre-accelerated pick-up ions and investigate their behaviour at the
shock. With the use of adiabatic approaches in the de Hoffman-Teller
frame of the shock, we calculate the energy distribution function of the
reflected part of pick-up ions. From the calculated distribution
functions it turns out that the reflected ions in the average suffer an
energy increase by about a factor of 10, still not enough to let them
move off the shock by spatial diffusion in the upstream direction. Thus,
since converted back into the shock, they can undergo repeated
reflections and energy gains till the diffusion-convection limit is
reached. As we show in addition, the reflection probability for pick-up
ions is about a factor of 10 higher than expected from the present
literature and strongly varies with the off-axis angle, pointing to the
fact that the termination shock represents a surface with a
three-dimensionally varying source strength for the production of
anomalous cosmic rays. The ACR source pattern is also expected to vary
during the solar cycle and the relevant injection energies are expected
to be larger by factors of 10 to 100 than the canonically adopted 1 keV
nucl$^{-1}$.
