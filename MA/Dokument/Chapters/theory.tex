Pickup ions are created when neutral atoms inside the heliosphere become ionised and are subsequently swept away with the heliospheric magnetic field that is embedded within the solar wind.

\section{Pickup Ions}
A neutral atom inside the heliosphere is only subjected to the gravitational force and radiation pressure of the sun. It is not sensitive to any electromagnetic forces until it becomes ionised by solar ultra-violet radiation, charge exchange with solar wind protons or electron impact (Q?). After ionisation the particle starts interacting with the solar wind plasma. In particular it is forced onto a gyro orbit about the heliospheric magnetic field
that is embedded within the solar wind. As the freshly created ion is swept away with the magnetic field line it is \say{picked up} from its location of ionisation -- a new pickup ion has been created.

The reason is that the majority is of interstellar origin

Discriminate from solar wind: VDF non-maxwellian and mostly single charged.
Once the particle is ionised, its probability to become ionised another time decreases (Quelle). This characteristic of being only singly charged can help to discriminate PUIs from solar wind ions, that are mostly more often charged (Q?).

Two sources of neutral atoms: Interstellar and Inner source
 Häufigkeit spiegelt nicht LISM-Häufigkeit wider wegen FIP
\section{VDF}
After the particle has been ionised it is forced onto a gyro motion about the local field line of the heliospheric magnetic field due to the Lorentz force. 


No velocity compared to vsw
\\ \\
B field is convected by the SW and moves radially outwards from the sun
\\ \\
Form of the torus depends on several factors: velocity of the particle before the PU process, orientation of the magentic field
