The ACE ancillary data file ACE_ANCIL.HDF contains two kinds of data.
The data are organized into two data structures (VGroups) in the HDF
file.

The first kind of data are the ACE spacecraft attitude and orbit
parameters. They are contained in  a VGroup called VG_attorb_entry. The
contents of the VGroup are described below.

The second kind of data are parameters used to convert the S/C clock
values into seconds since the S/C EPOCH, which was a short time after
ACE launch. They are contained in a VGroup called CG_ccr_entry, also
described below.
