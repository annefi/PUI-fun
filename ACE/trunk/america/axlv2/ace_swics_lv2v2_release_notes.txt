ACE/SWICS Level 2 Version 2 Data (preliminary) Release Notes
============================================================

Pre-release disclaimer!
-----------------------

This data has not been released yet and, though we applied reasonable
checks to it, must be considered preliminary.  If your work leads to
publication, please come back to us for the officially released data
first.


Format:
-------

There are headers in the data files that should make them pretty 
self-explanatory.  

The various 'qf' fields are quality flags.  If the flag is 1 then the
statistics are low and the error larger.  The flag is a disclaimer of
sorts meaning that this item appears to still be reasonable data but
we are less confident than when the flag is 0.  We actually report a
fill value (-1.0) when this problem makes the data unusable.
