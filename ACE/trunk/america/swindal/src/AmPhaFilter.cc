  Description:
    Code for the ACE/SWIMS PHA Filter class, a class for defining filters
    which removed certain PHA words from consideration.  This is an
    abstract base class only; it should never be instantiated.
    Rather, all filter-specific details are to be encapsulated in
    derived classes, e.g., AceSwimsSsdFilter.
